- Provides configurable analysis scope (full repository or specific modules)
- Calculates impact and confidence scores for findings
- Extensible design for adding new analysis patterns

### 3. Refactoring Suggester Component ✅

**File**: `sdk/refactoring_suggester.py`
**Purpose**: Generates AI-driven refactoring suggestions based on analysis findings

**Key Features**:
- Pattern-specific suggestion generation
- Generic suggestion framework for unknown patterns
- General architectural improvement suggestions
- Suggestion prioritization and scoring
- Detailed implementation plans

**Suggestion Types**:
- **God Class Refactoring**: Splits large classes into focused components
- **Circular Dependency Resolution**: Breaks circular dependencies between modules
- **Long Function Refactoring**: Extracts methods from lengthy functions
- **Large Module Organization**: Splits large modules into smaller ones
- **Utility Class Restructuring**: Organizes overloaded utility files
- **General Improvements**: Test coverage and documentation enhancements

**Implementation Details**:
- Configurable complexity, impact, and priority assessments
- Detailed step-by-step implementation plans
- Estimated effort hours for each suggestion
- Scoring algorithm based on multiple factors
- Extensible design for custom suggestion types

### 4. Refactoring Executor Component ✅

**File**: `sdk/refactoring_executor.py`
**Purpose**: Implements approved refactoring suggestions in sandboxed environments

**Key Features**:
- Sandbox environment provisioning
- Refactoring step execution
- Automated testing and validation
- Performance comparison generation
- Rollback capabilities
- Change tracking and reporting

**Execution Capabilities**:
- **Sandbox Management**: Provisioning and cleanup of isolated environments
- **Code Changes**: Application of refactoring steps with error handling
- **Testing**: Automated test execution to validate changes
- **Performance**: Before/after performance comparisons
- **Version Control**: Commit management and pull request creation
- **Rollback**: Automatic rollback on failure

**Implementation Details**:
- Kubernetes integration for sandbox orchestration (planned)
- Simulated execution for demonstration purposes
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Performance metrics collection
- Change tracking with detailed reporting

## Integration Points

### Agent SDK Integration
All core components integrate with the existing Agent SDK:
- Task status updates through `update_analysis_status()`
- Findings reporting through `report_findings()`
- Suggestions reporting through `report_suggestions()`
- Sandbox provisioning through `request_sandbox_provisioning()`
- Refactoring execution through `execute_refactoring()`

### API Integration
Components communicate with the devart.ai platform through REST API endpoints:
- Task creation and retrieval
- Status updates and progress tracking
- Findings and suggestions reporting
- Sandbox management
- Execution result reporting

### External System Integration (Planned)
Future integration points include:
- **GitHub**: Repository cloning and pull request creation
- **Grafana Tempo**: Performance data correlation
- **OpenAI**: Advanced AI-driven suggestion generation
- **Kubernetes**: Production sandbox environment management

## Usage Examples

### Basic Analysis Workflow
```python
# Initialize components
analyzer = CodebaseAnalyzer()
suggester = RefactoringSuggester()

# Clone and analyze repository
repo_path = analyzer.clone_repository("https://github.com/example/repo")
findings = analyzer.analyze_codebase(repo_path)

# Generate suggestions
suggestions = suggester.generate_suggestions(findings)

# Clean up
import shutil
shutil.rmtree(repo_path)
```

### Full Refactoring Execution
```python
# Initialize executor
executor = RefactoringExecutor()

# Provision sandbox
sandbox = executor.provision_sandbox("https://github.com/example/repo")

# Execute refactoring
result = executor.execute_refactoring(suggestion, "https://github.com/example/repo")

# Handle results
if result.success:
    print("Refactoring completed successfully")
else:
    print(f"Refactoring failed: {result.error}")
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Comprehensive unit tests cover:
- Component initialization
