# AI-driven Architecture Refactoring Agent - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the AI-driven Architecture Refactoring Agent for the devart.ai platform. The agent is designed to analyze codebases and performance data to suggest and implement architectural improvements.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Agent Structure
- Created a new agent directory: `devart-architecture-refactoring-agent`
- Implemented agent SDK with RabbitMQ integration for task consumption
- Added OpenTelemetry tracing capabilities
- Created main agent execution file with graceful shutdown handling

### 2. Database Schema
- Created new database tables for architecture analysis:
  - `architecture_analysis_tasks` - Stores analysis tasks
  - `architecture_findings` - Stores identified architectural issues
  - `refactoring_suggestions` - Stores AI-generated refactoring suggestions
  - `refactoring_executions` - Tracks execution of refactorings
- Added appropriate indexes for efficient querying
- Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Enabled Realtime replication for live updates

### 3. API Endpoints
- Implemented REST API endpoints in the Hono backend:
  - `POST /api/architecture-analysis` - Create new analysis task
  - `GET /api/architecture-analysis/:taskId` - Get task details
  - `PUT /api/architecture-analysis/:taskId/status` - Update task status
  - `POST /api/architecture-analysis/:taskId/findings` - Report findings
  - `POST /api/architecture-analysis/:taskId/suggestions` - Report suggestions
  - `POST /api/sandbox/provision` - Request sandbox provisioning
  - `POST /api/architecture-analysis/executions/:executionId/execute` - Execute refactoring

### 4. UI Components
- Created `ArchitectureAnalysisDashboard` component for the frontend
- Added navigation entry for "Architecture" in the main navigation
- Created dedicated page at `/architecture` route
- Implemented real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions

## Features Implemented

### Task Management
- Creation of architecture analysis tasks with repository details
- Status tracking (TODO, IN_PROGRESS, DONE, ERROR)
- Assignment to specific agents

### Analysis Results
- Storage and display of architectural findings
- Severity classification (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
- Impact and confidence scoring
- File and line number information

### Refactoring Suggestions
- AI-generated refactoring suggestions with implementation plans
- Complexity and impact assessment
- Priority classification
- Estimated effort hours

### Execution Tracking
- Sandbox provisioning requests
- Execution status tracking (PENDING, PROVISIONING, EXECUTING, SUCCESS, FAILED)
- Execution results with performance improvements
- Test results integration

## Pending Components

### Core Agent Functionality
- Task Consumer component for RabbitMQ message processing
- Codebase Analyzer for parsing and analyzing code structure
- Refactoring Suggester for generating AI-driven suggestions
- Refactoring Executor for implementing approved refactorings

### Middleware
- Authentication and authorization middleware
- Tracing middleware for observability

### Integration
- GitHub integration for repository access
- Grafana Tempo integration for performance data
- OpenAI integration for suggestion generation
- Kubernetes integration for sandbox management

### Testing
- Unit tests for core components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end workflow tests
- Performance tests for large repositories

## Next Steps

1. Implement the core agent components (Task Consumer, Codebase Analyzer, Refactoring Suggester, Refactoring Executor)
2. Add authentication and tracing middleware
3. Integrate with external systems (GitHub, Grafana Tempo, OpenAI, Kubernetes)
4. Develop comprehensive test suite
5. Implement the remaining UI components for full functionality

## Technology Stack

- **Agent**: Python with pika (RabbitMQ), requests, OpenTelemetry
