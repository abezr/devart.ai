# devart.ai - The Autonomous DevOps Platform

**A scalable, enterprise-ready control plane for orchestrating, supervising, and analyzing a team of autonomous GenAI agents. It functions as a deeply integrated partner in the modern software development lifecycle, transforming AI from a simple tool into a collaborative team member that can build, test, review, and deploy code within a secure, high-performance, and intuitive environment.**

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The system is built on a high-performance, scalable, and resilient architecture. It uses a message-driven pattern for task distribution, a container orchestrator for secure execution, and a real-time database for state synchronization and live UI updates.

## ‚ú® Core Features

### Supervisor Experience & Intelligibility

**Visual Workflow Monitor**: An interactive graph that visualizes task chains and dependencies, providing at-a-glance understanding of complex workflows.

**Centralized Activity Feed**: A real-time, streaming log of all significant system events, from task creation to agent status changes and budget alerts.

**Agent & Workflow Marketplace**: A browsable, searchable marketplace for discovering, sharing, and reusing pre-built agents and automation workflows.

### Advanced DevOps Integration

**Interactive GitHub Integration**: Agents can post comments and pass/fail status checks directly to Pull Requests, acting as automated code reviewers.

**Workflow Engine**: Define, manage, and trigger multi-stage, reusable workflows (e.g., build -> test -> review) from the UI or via API.

**Production Sandbox Orchestrator**: A robust Kubernetes integration for provisioning secure, isolated, and scalable execution environments for every agent task.

### Scalability & Enterprise Infrastructure

**Advanced Job Queue**: A high-throughput RabbitMQ message queue for task distribution, enabling delayed retries, dead-lettering, and a push-based architecture.

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Secure the platform with admin, supervisor, and viewer roles, enforced at the database level with RLS.

**Secure Agent Management**: Onboard agents with secure, hashed API keys and toggle their activation status from the UI.

### Intelligence & Orchestration

**Self-Healing Agents**: A built-in retry mechanism allows tasks to be automatically re-queued upon failure, enabling agents to recover from transient errors.

**Knowledge Base**: A pgvector-powered knowledge base allows agents to perform semantic searches for contextual information.

**Performance Analytics**: A dedicated dashboard panel provides insights into task costs and workflow performance.

**Intelligent Agent Dispatch**: A capability-aware task dispatch system that matches the right agent to the right job based on skills and requirements. See [Capability-Aware Dispatch Documentation](CAPABILITY_AWARE_DISPATCH.md) for details.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- Git, Node.js (v18+), pnpm
- Infrastructure: A running Kubernetes Cluster, a RabbitMQ instance
- Accounts: Cloudflare, Supabase, GitHub, OpenAI

### 2. Setup

**Clone & Install:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/devart.ai.git
cd devart.ai
pnpm install
```

**Supabase:**
- Create a new project and run the entire [supabase/schema.sql](supabase/schema.sql) script
- Enable the vector extension and enable Realtime for all tables

**Environment Variables:**
- Copy [.env.example](apps/api/.env.example) to `.env` in [apps/api](apps/api) and fill in all required keys from Supabase, OpenAI, GitHub, Kubernetes (a base64-encoded kubeconfig), and RabbitMQ (AMQP connection string)

**GitHub App:**
- Create a GitHub App with `pull_request:write` and `checks:write` permissions and install it on your target repository
- Configure a webhook pointing to your deployed API

### 3. Running Locally

```bash
# From the project root
pnpm dev
```
- UI: http://localhost:3000
- API: http://localhost:8787

## üß† System Concepts

**Message-Driven Architecture**: The core of the system is a message queue. The API acts as a Producer, publishing tasks to the queue. Agents act as Consumers, listening for work. This decouples the components and allows for massive horizontal scaling.

**Workflows**: Reusable, multi-stage templates for common CI/CD processes. Supervisors can trigger these with specific context, initiating a chain of tasks on the queue.

**Sandboxes**: Ephemeral, isolated Kubernetes Pods or Jobs provisioned on-demand for agents to perform their work, ensuring a clean and secure execution environment.

**Agent SDK**: A dedicated SDK (e.g., [devart-agent-template](devart-agent-template)) provides a simple interface for agents to connect to the message queue and interact with the platform's API.

**Agent Capabilities**: Agents can declare their skills and specializations, enabling the intelligent dispatch system to match them with appropriate tasks.

## üó∫Ô∏è Future Roadmap

The platform is now a mature, end-to-end solution. Future work will focus on deepening AI capabilities, enhancing the ecosystem, and achieving full multi-tenancy.

### Advanced AI & ML

- Implement the AI-driven Workflow Optimization engine that analyzes historical workflow_runs data to suggest more efficient processes
- Enhance the Self-Healing Agents by allowing them to query the knowledge base with their last_error to find potential solutions before retrying
- Create a "meta-agent" that can autonomously manage the agent workforce, scaling it up or down based on queue depth

### Ecosystem & Extensibility

- Build the full-featured UI for the Agent & Workflow Marketplace, including publishing and versioning workflows
- Develop a visual, drag-and-drop Workflow Builder in the UI
- Create a formal Plugin Architecture for adding new tools and integrations

### Platform & Multi-Tenancy

- Architect the platform to support multiple isolated organizations, enabling a potential SaaS offering
- Implement comprehensive, distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry) across all services for enterprise-grade observability
