## Implemented Components

### Core Components
1. **Task Consumer Component** - Consumes architecture analysis tasks from RabbitMQ queue
2. **Codebase Analyzer Component** - Parses and analyzes codebase structure to identify architectural patterns and anti-patterns
3. **Refactoring Suggester Component** - Uses AI to generate refactoring suggestions based on analysis results
4. **Refactoring Executor Component** - Implements approved refactoring suggestions in sandboxed environments

### Integration Modules
1. **GitHub Integration** - Fetches codebase data from GitHub repositories
2. **Grafana Tempo Integration** - Retrieves performance trace data for analysis
3. **OpenAI Integration** - Generates AI-driven refactoring suggestions
4. **Kubernetes Integration** - Provisions and manages sandboxed environments for refactoring execution

### Infrastructure
1. **Database Schema** - Created tables for architecture analysis tasks, findings, suggestions, and executions
2. **API Endpoints** - Implemented REST endpoints for all architecture analysis operations
3. **Middleware** - Added authentication, authorization, and tracing middleware
4. **UI Components** - Developed dashboard for displaying analysis results and refactoring suggestions

### Testing
