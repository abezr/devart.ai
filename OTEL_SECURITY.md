# OpenTelemetry Security Considerations

This document outlines the security measures implemented to protect sensitive data in the OpenTelemetry tracing implementation.

## Data Protection

### Excluded Information from Traces

The following types of sensitive information are excluded from traces:

1. **Authentication Tokens**
   - Authorization headers
   - API keys
   - Session tokens
   - JWT tokens

2. **Personal Identifiable Information (PII)**
   - Usernames
   - Email addresses
   - Phone numbers
   - Physical addresses
   - Social security numbers
   - Credit card information

3. **System Secrets**
   - Database connection strings
   - Private keys
   - Certificates
   - Environment-specific credentials

### Implementation Details

#### Backend (Hono/Cloudflare Workers)
- Sensitive headers are excluded from tracing spans
- Request/response bodies are not captured in traces
- Error messages are sanitized to remove sensitive data

#### Frontend (Next.js)
- Sensitive headers are excluded from fetch and XMLHttpRequest traces
- User input data is not captured in traces
- Client-side secrets are not included in trace attributes

#### Agent Services (Python)
- Environment variables containing secrets are not traced
- Sensitive data in message payloads is masked
- File paths and system information are sanitized

## Transport Security

### OTLP Communication
- All OTLP communication should use HTTPS in production
- mTLS can be configured for additional security
- Network policies restrict collector access to authorized services only

### Data Encryption
- Trace data is encrypted in transit using TLS
- At-rest encryption for trace storage in Grafana Tempo
- Secrets are never stored in trace data

## Access Control

### Tempo Query Access
- Tempo query endpoints are protected with authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC) limits who can query traces
- Audit logging for trace access and queries

### Grafana Dashboard Access
- Dashboard access follows RBAC principles
- Sensitive trace information is only visible to authorized users
- Export functionality is restricted to prevent data leakage

## Best Practices

### Development Guidelines
1. Never log sensitive information in span attributes
2. Use semantic conventions for attribute naming
3. Sanitize error messages before recording them
4. Regularly review trace data for sensitive information

### Production Deployment
1. Enable HTTPS for all OTLP endpoints
2. Configure authentication for collector endpoints
3. Implement network policies to restrict access
4. Regularly audit trace data for compliance
5. Monitor for unauthorized access to trace data

## Compliance

This implementation follows security best practices to ensure compliance with:
- GDPR for PII protection
- HIPAA for healthcare data (if applicable)
- SOC 2 for data security
- PCI DSS for payment data (if applicable)
