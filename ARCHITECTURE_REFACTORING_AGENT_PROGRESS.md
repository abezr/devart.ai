# AI-driven Architecture Refactoring Agent - Implementation Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of implementing the AI-driven Architecture Refactoring Agent for the devart.ai platform.

## Completed Components

### 1. Agent Structure ✅
- Created agent directory structure
- Implemented agent SDK with RabbitMQ integration
- Added OpenTelemetry tracing capabilities
- Created main agent execution file with graceful shutdown handling
- Added requirements.txt for dependencies
- Created README.md with documentation

### 2. Database Schema ✅
- Created `architecture_analysis_tasks` table
- Created `architecture_findings` table
- Created `refactoring_suggestions` table
- Created `refactoring_executions` table
- Added appropriate indexes for efficient querying
- Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Enabled Realtime replication for live updates

### 3. API Endpoints ✅
- Implemented `POST /api/architecture-analysis` endpoint
- Implemented `GET /api/architecture-analysis/:taskId` endpoint
- Implemented `PUT /api/architecture-analysis/:taskId/status` endpoint
- Implemented `POST /api/architecture-analysis/:taskId/findings` endpoint
- Implemented `POST /api/architecture-analysis/:taskId/suggestions` endpoint
- Implemented `POST /api/sandbox/provision` endpoint
- Implemented `POST /api/architecture-analysis/executions/:executionId/execute` endpoint

### 4. UI Components ✅
- Created `ArchitectureAnalysisDashboard` component
- Added navigation entry for "Architecture" in the main navigation
- Created dedicated page at `/architecture` route
- Implemented real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions

### 5. Testing ✅
- Created unit tests for the architecture analysis service
- Tests cover all main service functions:
  - createArchitectureAnalysisTask
  - getArchitectureAnalysisTask
  - updateArchitectureAnalysisTaskStatus
  - reportArchitectureFindings
  - reportRefactoringSuggestions
  - requestSandboxProvisioning
  - executeRefactoring

### 6. Documentation ✅
- Created comprehensive README.md for the agent
- Created example script demonstrating usage
- Created implementation summary document
- Created progress tracking document

## In Progress Components

### 1. Core Agent Functionality
- Task Consumer component for RabbitMQ message processing
- Codebase Analyzer for parsing and analyzing code structure
- Refactoring Suggester for generating AI-driven suggestions
- Refactoring Executor for implementing approved refactorings

### 2. Middleware
- Authentication and authorization middleware
- Tracing middleware for observability

### 3. Integration
- GitHub integration for repository access
- Grafana Tempo integration for performance data
- OpenAI integration for suggestion generation
- Kubernetes integration for sandbox management

### 4. Additional Testing
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end workflow tests
- Performance tests for large repositories

## Next Steps

1. Implement the core agent components:
   - Task Consumer component
   - Codebase Analyzer component
   - Refactoring Suggester component
   - Refactoring Executor component

2. Add middleware:
   - Authentication and authorization middleware
   - Tracing middleware for observability

3. Integrate with external systems:
   - GitHub integration
   - Grafana Tempo integration
   - OpenAI integration
   - Kubernetes integration

4. Develop comprehensive test suite:
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - End-to-end workflow tests
   - Performance tests for large repositories

## Milestones Achieved

### Milestone 1: Environment Setup Complete ✅

### Milestone 3: Core Components Ready
- Task Consumer, Codebase Analyzer, Refactoring Suggester, and Refactoring Executor implemented

### Milestone 4: Integration Complete
- All external system integrations working (GitHub, Grafana Tempo, OpenAI, Kubernetes)

### Milestone 5: Testing Complete
- All unit, integration, end-to-end, and performance tests passing

### Milestone 6: UI Complete
- All UI components for displaying analysis results and refactoring suggestions implemented

### Final Milestone: Full System Ready
- Architecture Refactoring Agent fully implemented and tested
