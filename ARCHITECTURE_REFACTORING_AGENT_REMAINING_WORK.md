   - Mitigation: Start with support for common languages and expand gradually

2. **AI Suggestion Quality**: Generated suggestions may be inaccurate or impractical
   - Mitigation: Implement validation and scoring mechanisms

3. **Sandbox Execution Reliability**: Sandbox environments may fail or behave unexpectedly
   - Mitigation: Implement robust error handling and rollback mechanisms

### Integration Risks
1. **API Changes**: External APIs may change, breaking integrations
   - Mitigation: Use versioned APIs and implement graceful degradation

2. **Rate Limiting**: External services may impose rate limits
   - Mitigation: Implement rate limiting and queuing mechanisms

### Resource Risks
1. **Development Time**: Implementation may take longer than estimated
   - Mitigation: Regular progress reviews and scope adjustments

2. **Computational Resources**: Analysis of large repositories may require significant resources
   - Mitigation: Implement resource monitoring and optimization
