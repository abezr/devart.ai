## Architecture Implemented

### System Components
1. **Web Dashboard**: Next.js frontend for user interaction
2. **API Layer**: Hono backend on Cloudflare Workers
3. **Database Layer**: Supabase PostgreSQL with RLS
4. **Messaging Layer**: RabbitMQ for task distribution
5. **Agent Layer**: Python agents for analysis and execution
6. **Observability**: OpenTelemetry for tracing and monitoring

### Data Flow
1. Users create analysis tasks through the web dashboard
2. Tasks are stored in Supabase and published to RabbitMQ
3. Agents consume tasks from RabbitMQ queue
4. Agents analyze codebases and report findings/suggestions
5. Results are stored in Supabase and pushed to dashboards
6. Users review suggestions and approve refactorings
7. Agents execute approved refactorings in sandboxed environments
8. Execution results are reported back to the system

## Security Features Implemented
- **Authentication**: Integration with Supabase Auth
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (admin, supervisor, viewer)
- **Data Protection**: Row Level Security policies
- **API Security**: Proper error handling without information leakage
- **Agent Security**: Secure API key handling

## Observability Features Implemented
