# devart.ai - The Autonomous DevOps Platform

devart.ai is a scalable, enterprise-ready, and self-expanding control plane for orchestrating, supervising, and analyzing a team of specialized GenAI agents. It functions as a deeply integrated partner in the modern software development lifecycle, capable of autonomously discovering, acquiring, and integrating new tools and services to continuously enhance its own capabilities.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The system is built on a high-performance, scalable, and resilient architecture. It uses a message-driven pattern for task distribution, a container orchestrator for secure execution, and a real-time database for state synchronization. A comprehensive AIOps stack with a proactive Root Cause Analysis, Generative Remediation, and a self-expanding Opportunity Pipeline provides deep, intelligent insight into every operation.

**Infrastructure**: Cloudflare Pages (UI) and Cloudflare Workers (API)

## ‚ú® Core Features

### Autonomous Ecosystem Expansion

**Opportunity Discovery Pipeline**: A multi-agent system that autonomously scans external sources (news feeds, blogs) to discover new free-tier services, trials, and partnership opportunities.

**AI-Powered Analysis & Qualification**: The pipeline uses LLMs to parse, classify, and analyze discovered opportunities, extracting structured data on their potential value to the platform.

**Automated Outreach & Integration**: A specialized PartnershipAgent handles lead generation and service registration, with a human-in-the-loop approval workflow. Once a new tool is acquired, an IntegrationPlannerAgent automatically creates the engineering tasks required to integrate it.

### Generative AIOps & Autonomous Resilience

**Generative Remediation**: For novel anomalies, the system uses LLMs to generate new, context-aware remediation scripts, which are presented to a human supervisor for validation and approval.

**Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Engine**: Automatically analyzes detected anomalies, identifies likely root causes, assigns a confidence score, and provides actionable recommendations.

**Self-Healing Agents**: A built-in retry mechanism with exponential backoff allows tasks to be automatically re-queued upon failure, enabling agents to recover from transient errors.

### Intelligent Orchestration & Specialization

**Capability-Aware Dispatch**: The orchestration engine intelligently matches tasks to agents based on their declared skills (e.g., ["python", "selenium"]), ensuring the right agent is always on the right job.

**Workflow Engine**: Define, manage, and trigger multi-stage, reusable workflows (e.g., build -> test -> review) from the UI or via API.

### Advanced DevOps Integration

**Interactive GitHub Integration**: Agents can post comments and pass/fail status checks directly to Pull Requests, acting as automated code reviewers.

**Production Sandbox Orchestrator**: A robust Kubernetes integration for provisioning secure, isolated, and scalable execution environments for every agent task.

### Scalability & Governance

**Advanced Job Queue**: A high-throughput RabbitMQ message queue for task distribution, enabling delayed retries, dead-lettering, and a push-based architecture.

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Secure the platform with admin, supervisor, and viewer roles, enforced at the database level with RLS.

## üöÄ Getting Started

## üß† System Concepts

**Opportunity Pipeline**: The platform's most proactive feature. It's a multi-agent assembly line that transforms unstructured information from the web into tangible, integrated capabilities for the platform, effectively allowing devart.ai to grow its own toolkit.

**Generative Remediation**: The pinnacle of the AIOps loop. When faced with an unknown issue, the platform leverages a large language model to generate a potential solution script. This script is sandboxed and presented to a human supervisor for approval.

**Observability**: The platform is fully instrumented with OpenTelemetry, allowing you to trace a single user action from a click in the UI, through the API, onto the message queue, into an agent's sandbox, and back.

**Capabilities**: Agents are defined by a set of skills (e.g., ["python", "react"]) and tasks are defined by a set of requirements. The orchestrator ensures a perfect match.

**Message-Driven Architecture**: The system uses a message queue for tasking. The API is a Producer, and specialized agents are Consumers that listen for jobs matching their capabilities.

## üó∫Ô∏è Future Roadmap

The platform is now a mature, end-to-end solution. Future work will focus on achieving full platform autonomy, enhancing the ecosystem, and achieving multi-tenancy.

### Advanced AI & ML

- **Autonomous Platform Evolution**: Develop a meta-agent that can analyze the platform's own roadmap, generate tasks for new features, and assign them to other agents, creating a fully self-evolving system
- **Predictive Remediation**: Implement a machine learning model that analyzes trace trends to predict and prevent anomalies before they occur

### Ecosystem & Extensibility

- Build the full-featured UI for the Agent & Workflow Marketplace, including publishing and versioning workflows
- Develop a visual, drag-and-drop Workflow Builder in the UI

### Platform & Multi-Tenancy

- Architect the platform to support multiple isolated organizations, enabling a potential SaaS offering
