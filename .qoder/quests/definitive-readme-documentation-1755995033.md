# devart.ai - The Autonomous DevOps Platform

devart.ai is a scalable, enterprise-ready, and fully observable control plane for orchestrating, supervising, and analyzing a team of specialized GenAI agents. It functions as a deeply integrated partner in the modern software development lifecycle, transforming AI from a simple tool into a collaborative, capability-aware team that can intelligently build, test, review, and deploy code.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The system is built on a high-performance, scalable, and resilient architecture. It uses a message-driven pattern for task distribution, a container orchestrator for secure execution, and a real-time database for state synchronization. End-to-end distributed tracing provides deep visibility into every operation.

## ‚ú® Core Features

### Enterprise Observability & Operations

**End-to-End Distributed Tracing:** Powered by OpenTelemetry, every request and workflow is traced across the frontend, backend API, message queue, and individual agents, providing unparalleled visibility for debugging and performance analysis.

**Performance Analytics:** A dedicated dashboard panel provides insights into task costs and workflow performance, with Grafana integration for advanced time-series metrics.

**Centralized Activity Feed:** A real-time, streaming log of all significant system events, from task creation to agent status changes and budget alerts.

### Intelligent Orchestration & Specialization

**Capability-Aware Dispatch:** The orchestration engine intelligently matches tasks to agents based on their declared skills (e.g., `["python", "code-review"]`), ensuring the right agent is always on the right job.

**Self-Healing Agents:** A built-in retry mechanism with exponential backoff allows tasks to be automatically re-queued upon failure, enabling agents to recover from transient errors and query a knowledge base for solutions.

**Workflow Engine:** Define, manage, and trigger multi-stage, reusable workflows (e.g., build ‚Üí test ‚Üí review) from the UI or via API.

### Advanced DevOps Integration

**Interactive GitHub Integration:** Agents can post comments and pass/fail status checks directly to Pull Requests, acting as automated code reviewers.

**Production Sandbox Orchestrator:** A robust Kubernetes integration for provisioning secure, isolated, and scalable execution environments for every agent task.

### Scalability & Governance

**Advanced Job Queue:** A high-throughput RabbitMQ message queue for task distribution, enabling delayed retries, dead-lettering, and a push-based architecture.

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Secure the platform with admin, supervisor, and viewer roles, enforced at the database level with RLS.

**Secure Agent Management:** Onboard agents with secure, hashed API keys and toggle their activation status from the UI.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- Git, Node.js (v18+), pnpm
- Infrastructure: A running Kubernetes Cluster, a RabbitMQ instance, and an OpenTelemetry Collector with a backend like Grafana Tempo
- Accounts: Cloudflare, Supabase, GitHub, OpenAI

### 2. Setup

**Clone & Install:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/devart.ai.git
cd devart.ai
pnpm install
```

**Supabase:**
1. Create a new project and run the entire `supabase/schema.sql` script
2. Enable the vector extension and enable Realtime for all tables

**Environment Variables:**
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in `apps/api` and `apps/ui`
2. Fill in all required keys, including the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` for your OpenTelemetry Collector

**GitHub App:**
1. Create a GitHub App with `pull_request:write` and `checks:write` permissions and install it on your target repository
2. Configure a webhook pointing to your deployed API

### 3. Running Locally

```bash
# From the project root
pnpm dev
```

- UI: http://localhost:3000
- API: http://localhost:8787

## üß† System Concepts

**Observability:** The platform is fully instrumented with OpenTelemetry. This allows you to trace a single user action from a click in the UI, through the API, onto the message queue, into an agent's sandbox, and back, making complex asynchronous workflows easy to debug.

**Capabilities:** Agents are defined by a set of skills (e.g., `["python", "react"]`) and tasks are defined by a set of requirements. The orchestrator ensures a perfect match.

**Message-Driven Architecture:** The system uses a message queue for tasking. The API is a Producer, and specialized agents are Consumers that listen for jobs matching their capabilities.

**Workflows:** Reusable, multi-stage templates for common CI/CD processes. Supervisors can trigger these with specific context, initiating a chain of tasks on the queue.

**Sandboxes:** Ephemeral, isolated Kubernetes Pods or Jobs provisioned on-demand for agents to perform their work, ensuring a clean and secure execution environment.

## üó∫Ô∏è Future Roadmap

The platform is now a mature, end-to-end solution. Future work will focus on deepening AI capabilities, enhancing the ecosystem, and achieving full multi-tenancy.

### Advanced AI & ML

- Implement the AI-driven Workflow Optimization engine that analyzes historical `workflow_runs` data to suggest more efficient processes
- Create a "meta-agent" that can autonomously manage the agent workforce, scaling it up or down based on queue depth and task requirements
- Implement Advanced Anomaly Detection on trace data to proactively identify performance regressions or security issues

### Ecosystem & Extensibility

- Build the full-featured UI for the Agent & Workflow Marketplace, including publishing and versioning workflows
- Develop a visual, drag-and-drop Workflow Builder in the UI

### Platform & Multi-Tenancy

- Architect the platform to support multiple isolated organizations, enabling a potential SaaS offering
