# Advanced Trace Anomaly Detection System Design

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the design for an advanced anomaly detection system that will proactively identify performance regressions and security issues in the devart.ai platform by analyzing trace data collected through OpenTelemetry. The system will build upon the existing observability infrastructure to provide intelligent alerts and automated flagging of anomalous behavior patterns.

### 1.1 Problem Statement

The current system has basic outlier detection for task costs using a statistical approach (average + 2 standard deviations), but lacks comprehensive anomaly detection capabilities for:
- Performance regressions (increased latency, error rates)
- Security issues (unusual access patterns, unauthorized operations)
- Resource consumption anomalies (CPU, memory, I/O spikes)
- Behavioral anomalies in agent operations

### 1.2 Objectives

1. Implement statistical and machine learning-based anomaly detection on trace data
2. Proactively identify performance regressions before they impact users
3. Detect potential security threats through unusual trace patterns
4. Integrate with existing alerting and monitoring infrastructure
5. Provide actionable insights for system operators and developers

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 System Components

The anomaly detection system will consist of the following components:

1. **Trace Data Collector** - Gathers trace data from Grafana Tempo
2. **Anomaly Detection Engine** - Processes trace data and identifies anomalies
3. **Alerting System** - Generates alerts for detected anomalies
4. **Storage Layer** - Stores anomaly detection results and metadata
5. **Dashboard UI** - Provides visualization of anomalies and system health

The system will integrate with existing components:
- Leverage the current OpenTelemetry infrastructure
- Extend the existing Grafana dashboards
- Integrate with the Telegram notification system
- Use the same Supabase database and real-time subscription patterns

## 3. Anomaly Detection Methods

### 3.1 Statistical Anomaly Detection

#### 3.1.1 Performance Metrics Anomalies
- **Latency Anomalies**: Detect when operation latency exceeds expected thresholds using:
  - Statistical process control (SPC) with control charts
  - Z-score analysis (values beyond 3 standard deviations)
  - Exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) for trend detection
  - Building upon the existing task cost outlier detection approach (average + 2 standard deviations)

#### 3.1.2 Error Rate Anomalies
- **Error Spike Detection**: Identify sudden increases in error rates using:
  - Moving averages with standard deviation thresholds
  - Cumulative sum (CUSUM) control charts
  - Seasonal decomposition for periodic patterns

#### 3.1.3 Throughput Anomalies
- **Traffic Spike Detection**: Detect unusual traffic patterns using:
  - Seasonal-trend decomposition
  - AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models
  - Threshold-based alerting with dynamic baselines

#### 3.1.4 Resource Consumption Anomalies
- **Resource Usage Spikes**: Detect unusual CPU, memory, or I/O usage patterns:
  - Rate of change analysis for resource metrics
  - Correlation analysis between resource usage and performance metrics
  - Baseline comparison with historical resource usage patterns

### 3.2 Machine Learning-Based Detection

#### 3.2.1 Unsupervised Learning
- **Clustering-based Anomaly Detection**: Group similar traces and identify outliers
- **Isolation Forests**: Effective for high-dimensional trace data
- **Autoencoders**: Neural networks for detecting anomalous trace patterns
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimensionality reduction for efficient anomaly detection

#### 3.2.2 Supervised Learning
- **Classification Models**: Train models to distinguish between normal and anomalous traces
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models for improved accuracy
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Predict future metric values and detect deviations

#### 3.2.3 Implementation Approach
- Start with lightweight statistical methods for initial implementation
- Gradually introduce machine learning models as system complexity grows
- Use existing Python libraries compatible with the agent template environment
- Implement model serving through Cloudflare Worker compatibility

### 3.3 Security Anomaly Detection

#### 3.3.1 Access Pattern Anomalies
- Detect unusual access patterns that may indicate security threats:
  - Unauthorized service interactions
  - Suspicious data access patterns
  - Abnormal authentication attempts
  - Geographic anomalies in access patterns

#### 3.3.2 Behavioral Anomalies
- Identify deviations from normal operational behavior:
  - Unusual sequence of operations
  - Unexpected data flows
  - Resource usage anomalies
  - Timing-based anomalies (operations at unusual hours)

#### 3.3.3 Implementation Considerations
- Ensure compliance with data protection policies defined in `OTEL_SECURITY.md`
- Exclude sensitive information from analysis as per existing tracing security practices
- Implement role-based access controls for security anomaly investigations
- Integrate with existing activity logging in the `activity_log` table

## 4. Implementation Plan

### 4.1 Backend Implementation

#### 4.1.1 Anomaly Detection Service
Create a new service in the backend to handle anomaly detection:

```
apps/api/src/services/anomalyDetection.ts
```

Key functions:
- `collectTraceData()`: Retrieve trace data from Grafana Tempo
- `detectAnomalies()`: Apply detection algorithms to trace data
- `generateAlerts()`: Create alerts for detected anomalies
- `storeResults()`: Save detection results for analysis

The service will integrate with the existing Hono API framework and follow the same patterns as other services in `apps/api/src/services/`.

#### 4.1.2 Database Schema
Add tables for storing anomaly detection results:

```sql
-- Anomaly detection results
CREATE TABLE trace_anomalies (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  trace_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  span_id TEXT,
  anomaly_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'PERFORMANCE', 'SECURITY', 'RESOURCE'
  anomaly_subtype TEXT, -- Specific type of anomaly
  severity TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'LOW', 'MEDIUM', 'HIGH', 'CRITICAL'
  description TEXT,
  detected_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  resolved BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  resolution_notes TEXT
);

-- Anomaly detection configuration
CREATE TABLE anomaly_detection_config (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  config_key TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  config_value JSONB,
  description TEXT
);

-- Add indexes for efficient querying
CREATE INDEX idx_trace_anomalies_type ON trace_anomalies(anomaly_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_trace_anomalies_severity ON trace_anomalies(severity);
CREATE INDEX idx_trace_anomalies_detected ON trace_anomalies(detected_at);
```

These tables will be added to the existing schema in `supabase/schema.sql` and will follow the same RLS policies as other system tables.

### 4.2 Frontend Implementation

#### 4.2.1 Anomaly Dashboard
Create a new dashboard component to visualize anomalies:

```
apps/ui/src/components/AnomalyDashboard.tsx
```

Features:
- Real-time anomaly visualization
- Filtering by anomaly type, severity, and time range
- Drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis
- Integration with existing Grafana panels
- Connection to Supabase real-time subscriptions for live updates

The dashboard will follow the same design patterns as existing components like `TaskBoard.tsx` and `ServiceStatusPanel.tsx`, using Tailwind CSS for styling and Supabase for data access.

#### 4.2.2 Alert Panel
Add an alert panel to the supervisor dashboard:

```
apps/ui/src/components/AnomalyAlertPanel.tsx
```

Features:
- Summary of active anomalies
- Severity-based alert prioritization
- Quick resolution actions
- Integration with Telegram notifications for critical alerts

This component will be added to the main supervisor dashboard alongside existing panels like `ServiceStatusPanel.tsx` and `AgentMonitoringPanel.tsx`.
