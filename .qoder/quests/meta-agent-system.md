# Meta-Agent System Design for Autonomous Platform Evolution

## 1. Overview

The Meta-Agent System is designed to create a fully self-evolving platform that can analyze its own roadmap, generate tasks for new features, and assign them to other agents. This system implements a hybrid approach using LlamaIndex for the "Analysis" layer and Langroid for the "Orchestration" layer, enabling the platform to autonomously evolve and improve itself.

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

The Meta-Agent System will:
- Analyze the platform's roadmap documents to identify upcoming features
- Generate new tasks based on roadmap analysis
- Assign tasks to appropriate agents based on their capabilities
- Monitor task completion and platform evolution
- Continuously improve its own analysis and decision-making capabilities

### 1.2 Key Benefits

- **Self-Evolving Platform**: The system can autonomously identify and implement new features
- **Best-in-Class RAG**: Leverages LlamaIndex's advanced parsing, indexing, and querying capabilities
- **Purpose-Built Orchestration**: Uses Langroid for managing complex, stateful conversations between agents
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Modular design with distinct data and orchestration layers

## 2. System Architecture

The Meta-Agent System follows a two-phase architecture with clear separation between data analysis and task orchestration:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Phase 1: Data Ingestion (LlamaIndex)"
        A[Roadmap Documents <br/>(PDFs, Markdown, etc.)] --> B{LlamaIndex Ingestion Pipeline};
        B --> C[Chunking & Metadata Extraction];
        C --> D[OpenAI Embedding API];
        D --> E[PGVector Knowledge Base];
    end

    subgraph "Phase 2: Agentic Execution (Langroid)"
        F[Meta-Agent (Langroid)] -- "1. What's next on the roadmap?" --> G{Query Engine (LlamaIndex)};
        G -- "2. Retrieves relevant context" --> E;
        G -- "3. Synthesized answer" --> F;
        
        F -- "4. Analyzes answer, generates new feature tasks" --> F;
        
        F -- "5. 'Assign this task: ...'" --> H[Task Assigner Agent (Langroid)];
        H -- "6. Finds best agent for the job" --> I[devart.ai Agent Registry];
        H -- "7. Creates task via API" --> J[devart.ai API <br/>(POST /api/tasks)];
    end
```

### 2.1 Component Breakdown

#### 2.1.1 LlamaIndex Analysis Layer

- **Chunking & Metadata Extraction**: Intelligently breaks down documents and extracts relevant metadata
- **Vector Embedding**: Uses OpenAI API to generate embeddings for semantic search
- **Knowledge Base**: Stores processed information in PGVector for efficient retrieval

#### 2.1.2 Langroid Orchestration Layer
- **Meta-Agent**: Central agent that analyzes roadmap context and generates new tasks
- **Query Engine**: Interfaces with LlamaIndex to retrieve relevant roadmap information
- **Task Assigner Agent**: Assigns generated tasks to appropriate agents based on capabilities
