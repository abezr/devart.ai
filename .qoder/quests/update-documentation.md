## Final README.md Content

# devart.ai - The Autonomous DevOps Platform

devart.ai is a serverless, enterprise-ready control plane for orchestrating, supervising, and analyzing a team of autonomous GenAI agents. It functions as a deeply integrated partner in the modern software development lifecycle, transforming AI from a simple tool into a collaborative team member that can build, test, review, and deploy code.

## ‚ú® Core Features

### Advanced DevOps Integration
- **Interactive GitHub Integration**: Agents can post comments and pass/fail status checks directly to Pull Requests, acting as automated code reviewers.
- **Workflow Engine**: Define, manage, and trigger multi-stage, reusable workflows (e.g., build -> test -> review) from the UI or via API.
- **Agent Execution Sandboxing**: Provide agents with clean, isolated, and containerized environments for executing tasks securely and reproducibly.

### Governance & Security
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Secure the platform with admin, supervisor, and viewer roles, enforced at the database level with RLS.
- **Secure Agent Management**: Onboard agents with secure, hashed API keys and toggle their activation status from the UI.
- **Dynamic System Configuration**: Tune system parameters, like performance thresholds, from a live settings panel without redeploying.

### Orchestration & Collaboration
- **Autonomous Agent Lifecycle**: Agents can register, claim tasks from a priority queue, and report their status.
- **Atomic Task Claiming**: A race-condition-free queue system (FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED) ensures tasks are never worked on by multiple agents.
- **Task Chaining**: Agents can create successor tasks, enabling complex, multi-step workflows.

### Intelligence & Analytics
- **Knowledge Base**: A pgvector-powered knowledge base allows agents to perform semantic searches for contextual information.
- **Performance Analytics**: A dedicated dashboard panel provides insights into task costs and service usage patterns.
- **Outlier Detection**: The system automatically flags tasks with unusually high costs for supervisor review.

### Supervision & Control
- **Real-Time Dashboards**: Live, streaming updates for tasks, agents, and service budgets using Supabase Realtime.
- **Interactive Task Management**: Supervisors can create, prioritize, update, and delete tasks from the UI.
- **Budget Supervisor**: Set monthly spending limits on external services (e.g., LLM APIs), with automatic suspension, delegation to cheaper alternatives, and proactive Telegram alerts.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- Git, Node.js (v18+), pnpm, Docker (for local sandboxing)
- Accounts: Cloudflare, Supabase, GitHub, OpenAI, Telegram

### 2. Setup

**Clone & Install:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/devart.ai.git
cd devart.ai
pnpm install
```

**Supabase:**
- Create a new project on Supabase.
- In the SQL Editor, run the entire `supabase/schema.sql` script.
- Enable the vector extension under Database -> Extensions.
- Enable Realtime for all tables under Database -> Replication.

**Environment Variables:**
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in `apps/api`.
- Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` in `apps/ui`.
- Fill in all required keys from Supabase, OpenAI, and Telegram.

**GitHub App:**
- Go to your GitHub profile Settings -> Developer settings -> GitHub Apps -> New GitHub App.
- Give it a name (e.g., "DevArt.ai Reviewer").
- Set the Webhook URL to your deployed API endpoint (e.g., `https://<your-worker>/api/webhooks/github`).
- Generate and store a Webhook secret. Add this to your `.env` as `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
- Under Repository permissions, grant Read & write access for Checks and Pull requests.
- Create the App. On the next page, generate a private key and save the `.pem` file.
- Note the App ID. Add the App ID and the content of the `.pem` file to your `.env`.
- Finally, Install the App on your target repository and note the Installation ID. Add this to your `.env`.

### 3. Running Locally

```bash
# From the project root
pnpm dev
```
- UI: http://localhost:3000
- API: http://localhost:8787

### 4. Deployment
Follow the detailed instructions in the initial project setup to deploy the API to Cloudflare Workers and the UI to Cloudflare Pages. Remember to set all production secrets using `wrangler secret put`.

## üß† System Concepts

### Workflows
Reusable, multi-stage templates for common CI/CD processes (e.g., Build -> Test -> Deploy). Supervisors can trigger these with specific context.

### Sandboxes
Ephemeral, isolated Docker containers provisioned on-demand for agents to perform their work, ensuring a clean and secure execution environment.

### Agents
Autonomous workers that register with the platform, claim tasks, and execute them using a secure API key. A starter template is available at `devart-agent-template`.

### Tasks
Discrete units of work that can be created by supervisors, other agents (chaining), or external systems (webhooks).

## Agent Task Lifecycle

The core agent loop is a simple, robust process facilitated by the API.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent
    participant API
    participant Database

    loop Work Cycle
        Agent->>API: POST /api/agents/{agentId}/claim-task
        API->>Database: RPC claim_next_task()
        Database-->>API: Returns available task (or null)
        API-->>Agent: Task JSON (or 404)
        
        alt Task Claimed
            Agent->>Agent: Process Task (Core Logic)
            Agent->>API: PUT /api/tasks/{taskId}/status (body: {status: "DONE"})
            API->>Database: UPDATE tasks, UPDATE agents
            Database-->>API: Success
            API-->>Agent: 200 OK
        else No Task Available
            Agent->>Agent: Wait (e.g., 30 seconds)
        end
    end
```

## üó∫Ô∏è Future Roadmap

The platform is now a mature, end-to-end solution. Future work will focus on enterprise-scale, advanced AI, and ecosystem growth.

### Scalability & Performance
- **Production Sandbox Orchestrator**: Migrate the conceptual sandbox provisioner to a robust Kubernetes or Nomad integration.
- **Materialized Views**: Implement materialized views for high-performance analytics on very large datasets.
- **Advanced Job Queue**: Introduce a dedicated job queue backend like RabbitMQ for advanced routing, retries, and dead-letter queues.

### Advanced AI & ML
- **Self-Healing Agents**: Develop agents that can analyze their own errors, query the knowledge base for solutions, and retry tasks with modified approaches.
- **Predictive Cost Analysis**: Implement a machine learning model to estimate task costs before execution based on historical data.
- **Workflow Optimization**: Create a "meta-agent" that analyzes workflow performance and suggests optimizations, such as reordering stages or using different services.

### Ecosystem & Extensibility
- **Plugin Architecture**: Develop a formal plugin system for adding new tools, integrations, and agent capabilities without modifying the core platform.
- **Agent & Workflow Marketplace**: Create a shared repository for discovering and importing pre-built agents and workflows for common tasks.
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Architect the platform to support multiple isolated organizations, enabling a potential SaaS offering.
