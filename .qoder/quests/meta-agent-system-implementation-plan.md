# Meta-Agent System Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Meta-Agent System based on the design document. The plan is organized into five phases that follow the system architecture.

## Phase 1: LlamaIndex Analysis Layer Implementation

This phase focuses on building the knowledge core ingestion pipeline that creates a hybrid knowledge structure from roadmap documents.

### Tasks:
1. **Implement Hybrid Knowledge Core** - Set up LlamaIndex Ingestion Pipeline with SimpleDirectoryReader for PDF handling
2. **Integrate OCR tool** - Integrate OCR tool (pytesseract) to extract text from images within PDFs
3. **Implement advanced NodeParser** - Implement advanced NodeParser (SentenceWindowNodeParser) for intelligent chunking
4. **Generate embeddings** - Generate embeddings using LlamaIndex's OpenAIEmbedding integration
5. **Populate Vector Store** - Populate Vector Store in existing PGVector database via PGVectorStore adapter
6. **Create Knowledge Graph** - Create Knowledge Graph by making LLM calls to extract key entities and relationships
7. **Store structured relationships** - Store structured relationships in new PostgreSQL table (roadmap_kg)
8. **Build Hybrid Query Engine** - Build Hybrid Query Engine using LlamaIndex's RouterQueryEngine

## Phase 2: Langroid Orchestration Layer Implementation

This phase develops the multi-agent system that uses the Knowledge Core to reason about the roadmap and generate actionable engineering tasks.

### Tasks:
1. **Define Agent Roles** - Define Agent Roles in Langroid: SupervisorAgent, SpecWriterAgent, TaskGeneratorAgent
2. **Implement Orchestration Logic** - Implement Orchestration Logic for multi-agent system
3. **Create main script** - Create main script that initializes the three agents
4. **Implement SupervisorAgent** - Implement SupervisorAgent to query Knowledge Core and orchestrate workflow
5. **Implement SpecWriterAgent** - Implement SpecWriterAgent to produce technical specifications from high-level goals
6. **Implement TaskGeneratorAgent** - Implement TaskGeneratorAgent to break specs into engineering tasks
7. **Create Final Tool** - Create Final Tool for TaskGeneratorAgent to call POST /api/tasks endpoint

## Phase 3: Evaluation Feedback Loop Implementation

This phase closes the loop by enabling the meta-agent to create evaluation tasks and implement a feedback mechanism.

### Tasks:
1. **Enhance TaskGeneratorAgent** - Enhance TaskGeneratorAgent to generate evaluation tasks after feature tasks
2. **Create Ingestion Endpoint** - Create Ingestion Endpoint for Evaluation Results: POST /api/knowledge/evaluation-result
3. **Implement feedback mechanism** - Implement mechanism for evaluation results to be fed back into Knowledge Base

## Phase 4: Testing and Quality Assurance

This phase ensures the system functions correctly through comprehensive testing.

### Tasks:
1. **Document Ingestion Tests** - Write unit tests for Document Ingestion components
2. **Knowledge Graph Tests** - Write unit tests for Knowledge Graph functionality
3. **Agent Tests** - Write unit tests for Agent components
4. **Integration Tests** - Implement integration tests for end-to-end workflow
5. **Performance Tests** - Implement performance tests for processing large roadmap documents

## Phase 5: Security and Monitoring

This phase implements security measures and observability features.

### Tasks:
1. **Security Implementation** - Implement security measures: API authentication, rate limiting, data privacy
2. **Monitoring Setup** - Set up monitoring and observability: logging, metrics, tracing, alerting

## Implementation Approach

The implementation should follow this phased approach to ensure proper integration and testing of each component:

1. Start with Phase 1 to establish the data ingestion and storage foundation
2. Proceed to Phase 2 to build the multi-agent orchestration system
3. Implement Phase 3 to enable the evaluation feedback loop
4. Execute Phase 4 to validate the system functionality
5. Complete with Phase 5 to secure and monitor the system

Each task should be implemented and tested independently before moving to the next, with integration testing performed at the end of each phase.
